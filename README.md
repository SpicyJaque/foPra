Deficits, Discipline, and Debt Debates.
A Computational Social Science Approach to comprehend
political perspectives on fiscal Policy in Germany and Austria.

This analysis examines manifestos by political parties from Germany and Austria on their
position towards fiscal policy. Germany has long been characterized by a cautious approach
to public debt and inflation, deeply embedded in what scholars have termed its “stability
culture” (Schmidt 1989). This economic perception prioritizes balanced budgets and price
stability. The European fiscal crisis of the early 2010s reinforced this approach, with German
policymakers advocating for strict austerity measures, both domestically, and across the
Eurozone. By tracing shifts in political discourse, this study offers a comparative perspective
on fiscal policy positions.
The research uses a computational social science approach to explore political perspectives
on fiscal policy in Germany and Austria. Conceptionally, it is grounded in understanding
fiscal policies, public debt, and their socio-political implications, drawing on prior works
like Streeck’s analysis of the evolution of fiscal states and Martin’s perspectives on partisan
cleavages in fiscal policy. Additionally, this research examines previous research on budget
policy in party programs.
